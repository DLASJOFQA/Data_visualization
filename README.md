Customer habits of Ford GoBike System for the year 2019 by 
(Islam Muhammad) 
Dataset : Ford GoBike 
 
Investigation Overview 
In this investigation, I want to look at the common customer behavior and characteristics of 
the Bay Area FordGoBike system. The main focus of my investigation is the strength of the 
relationship between user type, age, and flight time. 
Dataset Overview 
The data structure now consists of 173467 rows and 17 columns, which is summarized in the 
data of the flight time in terms of the start and end time and the duration of the trip. There are 
also data for the start and end stations and user data such as the type of the user, his age and 
the gender of the user. 
 
Summary 
In exploring, I found that there are two types of customers who use the system: subscribers 
who use it for their daily commute, who have short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on
weekdays from 8 to 9 in the morning and 5 to 6 in the evening, and customers, usually 
tourists. Or occasional riders who use the system mainly on weekends, and we also found a 
relationship between the type of user and the time of the trip, as users of the type of 
customers spend more time throughout the week compared to the type of subscribing users 
and this is despite the fact that the number of subscribers is much greater than the customers 
as we found that there is between them And between the age of the user as well, as the age 
group between 25 to 35 is the most time consuming of the travel time and this category has a 
high percentage in the type of customers 
Key Insights for Presentation 
We have also identified information about most of the starting and ending stations, and this 
information can be used to provide bicycles so that there is no disability due to the high 
demand for degrees in these stations. We also set the highest rental days and hours for both 
types of users
